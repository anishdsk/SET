# SET-Card-Game
Created in an attempt to learn and understand Ruby fundamentals.

STEPS to run this game:

1.) Download all contents

2.) Within the folder run "ruby game.rb" from the command line

3.) Follow the instructions

NOTES:

1.) This game is a two player and turn-based version of the SET card game

2.) Players start by typing in their name

3.) Each card has a unique identifier attached to it, when players type in what cards they think form a set, they only have to type in the card's identifier without the '#', so just the 3 digit numbers followed by spaces between them. So for example "121, 122, 123" would be what a player would type in response to being asked what cards they think form a set as the identifier will be showed along with its respective card on the game screen. This is just to make the player typing experience easier.

4.) When it is a player's turn, they can also hit 'q', instead of the card identifiers, to end the game early and determine a winner

5.) Every other aspect of the game flows by the instructions showed on the screen and by the game's original rules
